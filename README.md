Basic
=====

I got bored one day so I wrote a BASIC parser. It's a pretty basic dialect BASIC with no support for functions or anything complex like that. The usage is simple

	php basic.php name_of_basic_file.basic
	
Check out the example file included in this repo for the syntax. I've commented the code a lot; writing this was a learning exercise, and reading it could be pretty useful too if you're interested in writing parsers.
